<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://dgca.gov.in/digigov-portal/">Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)</a> in India has unveiled a policy of &quot;No permission - No takeoff&quot; for drone flights. This means that public and private companies intending to fly drones in India need to interface with DGCA&#39;s infrastructure for flight permissions and other authorizations. These APIs are called India&#39;s <a href="https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in/">Digital Sky</a> eco-system. Aerobridge is a server that helps you interface with the APIs in a standardized fashion and be in compliance with the regulatory requirements around operating drones.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-aerobridge-help-you-">How can Aerobridge help you?</h2>
<p>If you are a drone manufacturer, operator or just a researcher, you can benefit by adopting Aerobridge in your operational stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard way to communicate with Digital Sky APIs</li>
<li>Integration with PX4 / Ardupilot</li>
<li>Manage permission artefacts and flight logs</li>
<li>RFM integration</li>
<li>Easily manage compliance with NPNT</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="test-drive">Test drive</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can see the frontend using the <a href="https://aerobridgetestflight.herokuapp.com/launchpad">Testflight frontend</a></li>
<li>Take a look at the backend API: <a href="https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openskies-sh/aerobridge/master/api/aerobridge-1.0.0.resolved.yaml">Aerobridge OpenAPI renderer</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="webinar-and-pilot-program-">Webinar and pilot program âœ¨</h2>
<p>We work with drone manufacturers to enable them to become compliant with NPNT by regular onboarding run through our canary program. You can find out more about this on our regular <a href="https://webinar.aerobridge.in">webinar</a>.</p>
<h2 id="get-involved">Get Involved</h2>
<p>Aerobridge is fully open source and you can get involved by participating in our weekly calls (details shortly) and our Slack channel: <a href="https://forms.gle/qdUgjJHiFQn2Yuhg6">Request access here</a>.

</ul>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>This is an open source implementation of the &quot;Manufacturer&#39;s Management Server&quot; to help with key signing and managing interactions with India&#39;s <a href="https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in/">Digital Sky</a> API infrastructure. This server can be deployed to any public and private cloud and be used to manage communication with DGCA&#39;s Digital Sky Infrastructure and manage NPNT permissions. For a more technical introduction, see this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cZrNwNrLtLIj5eKEGql2HN-G1gZFbbGhGbiTB1i16So/edit?usp=sharing">presentation</a>.</p>
