            <p>
                Aerobridge is licensed under a BSL license popularized by other products such as <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/licensing-faqs.html">CockroachDB</a> and
                <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry">Sentry</a>. Basically, it means the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You cannot offer a version of Aerobridge as a service to third parties, if you want to do this, you will need an agreement with Openskies (the license grant restriction)</li>
                <li>After 24 months, the code becomes Apache-2.0 licensed (the conversion period)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In other words, if you want to host / run Aerobridge inside your company for your own operations, you are free to do so without any concerns or restrictions. If you want to offer services to third parties using a release of
                Aerobridge the opensource project that is less than two years old, you will need an agreement from Openskies.
